## Setup

You can manually clone the repo and then run `npm install`, or you can do it the Adonis way:

First, install all packages:

```bash
cd cafe
npm install
```

#### Development:
To start developing your app, do:

```js
npm run dev
```

This will concurrently serve your app on localhost:3333 and compile (and watch) the frontend assets
